			<strong>User Story 1:</strong> As a user, I want to be able to access a portal that lets me look at my schedule for the week ahead that allows me to schedule any tasks I may have to do, so that I can keep them in mind and be productive when those time slots occur.
			<br>
			Extended description - From the homepage, the user can click the minimized Weekly Schedule UI, which will bring the user to a portal that lets the user look at a weekly schedule. The days of the week are aligned horizontally, with individual tasks listed below each day. In terms of good time management, this function may help the user maintain a broader perspective in terms of what tasks need to be completed in the near future.

			<strong>User Story 2:</strong> As a user, I want to be able to add a task and assign designated time for the task in my agenda, so that I can create a schedule for my productivity.
			<br>
			Extended description - To add a task, the user navigates from the homepage to the weekly schedule UI. At the bottom of each day of the week is an Add Task button. Clicking this field will open a small window that prompts the user to give the task a title from the keyboard. Additionally, the user can designate an amount of time for the task by using either the incrementing/decrementing buttons to the right of the time field, or by entering the desired value from the keyboard.

			<strong>User Story 3:</strong> As a user, I want to be able to edit an existing task in my schedule
			<br>
			Extended description - To edit a task, the user navigates from the homepage to the weekly schedule UI.  Under each day of the week is, if any, a list of existing tasks previously entered by the user. In the top right corner of a task field is an Edit Task button. Clicking this field will open a small window similar to the Add Task window, where the user can enter a new title from the keyboard. Additionally, the user can designate a new amount of time for the task by using either the incrementing/decrementing buttons to the right of the time field, or by entering the desired value from the keyboard.

			<strong>User Story 4:</strong> As a user, I want to be able to begin a task, which will start a Pomodoro timer and a timer counting down from that task's designated time, so that I can designate an amount of time to stay focused for.
			<br>
			Extended description - To begin a task, the user navigates to the homepage. From the homepage, Today’s Tasks and Timer App are both visible. First, the user must select a task by clicking the task’s title. If no task is selected, the title field of the Timer App reads “No Active Task.” However, once a task has been selected, the title field of the Timer App will display the given title of the selected task. After selecting a task, the user clicks the green Start button, and a timer will begin counting down from the task’s designated amount of time.

			<br><br><br>
			<strong>User Story 5:</strong> As a user, I want to be able to change the amount of time allotted for breaks and studying that the app assigns (defaults to Pomodoro method), so that I can adjust these times to better suit my needs or preferences.
			<br>
			Extended description - To edit the amount of time allotted for breaks and work periods, the user navigates to the homepage. From the homepage, the Timer App is visible, and at the bottom right corner of the Timer App field is a small settings icon, in the shape of a cog. The user clicks this cog, which will expand a timer settings window, displaying the lengths of time assigned to the Pomodoro, the short break, and the long break. The user can designate a new amount of time for each of these fields by using either the incrementing/decrementing buttons to the right of each time field, or by entering the desired value(s) from the keyboard.

			<strong>User Story 6:</strong> As a user, I want to be able to quickly access a checklist which shows which tasks are done and which tasks need to be done, so that I can keep track of the amount of tasks I have and haven't completed.
			<br>
			Extended description - To quickly access a checklist of complete and incomplete tasks, the user navigates to the homepage. From the homepage, the Today’s Tasks field is visible, where each of today’s tasks are listed vertically. Each displayed task contains a title and a designated time amount, and to the right of each these task descriptions are checkboxes. Once a task is completed, the user can check the checkbox designated to the complete task, signifying the tasks completion. By viewing which tasks are checked and unchecked, the user can quickly determine which tasks are finished and which tasks still need to be completed.

          <h5 class="card-title title">1. Research Question & Methodology</h5>
			<p class="card-text response"> 
				Our research question for this term project is: “Can distractions and a decrease in productivity caused by remote work be mitigated through the use of time-management applications?”. 
				<br>
				In order to test this research question, our group decided upon using the observation/participant observation methodology in order to gauge the effectiveness of our application.
			</p>
		<div class="card sub-promt last">
		  <h5 class="card-title title">2. Describing Our Testing Procedure</h5>
            <p class="card-text response"> 
				Based on the methodology our group selected, our testing procedure would involve letting our selected participants attempt to complete some sort of task our group would decide upon beforehand. This task would likely be something simple and easy to do, such as writing a brief paper or perhaps creating some type of spreadsheet. We would inform participants how to complete the tasks before testing to reduce the confounding variable of participants not knowing how to complete the task.
				<br>
				Before the procedure would begin, our group’s plan for informed consent would likely be a combination of both telling participants what to expect from their involvement, as well as providing them with some sort of diagram, visual aid, or brief written document restating this.
				<br>
				The data our group would collect would be the amount of time it takes the participants to complete some type of task. This part would take into consideration various factors, including a control with no type of time-management app, a test(s) with a different time-management app, and one using our time management app.
				<br>
				To analyze this data, we would likely conduct multiple repeated tests, and compare the averages of each result, seeing which factors allowed the participants to easily complete the tasks. While there could obviously be many confounding variables involved with the nature of this study, this could serve as a strong foundation for further research if our group wished to do so in the future.
				<br>
				If our group were to safely conduct this testing procedure during the pandemic, we would likely use some sort of computer lab set up with proper social distancing. We’d additionally ensure that all participants wear a face mask, and that all keyboards and computers are sanitized before and after each use.

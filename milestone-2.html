            The problem of study our group will be examining is the issue of
            dealing with time management and distractions caused by remote work.
            We believe that one of the biggest issues with time management
            unique to remote work is the fact that not being present at the
            workplace causes a lack of direct supervision. We think this could
            lead to being more prone to distractions (mainly online), and
            therefore directly contributing to workers being less productive.
            Our group believes this issue is especially relevant due to the
            current state of society because of Covid-19, which has necessitated
            the need for remote work. Therefore, our group will attempt to find
            solutions to time management and distractions in a remote working
            environment, and how to mitigate the identified issues by selecting
            various types of time-tracking apps and/or interfaces and seeing how
            we can improve or refine their interfaces through detailed analysis.
            In turn, our group hopes that this form of analysis will allow us to
            either create or learn better, more efficient ways for people to
            complete remote work. <br />Using the Seven Stages of Action, we can
            propose a typical interaction related to this problem. <br />1. Our
            hypothetical user’s goal would be that they are attempting to
            complete a task, in this case, we’ll say that they are attempting to
            finish writing a large section of code for the company they work at.
            Because they’re stuck at home due to the pandemic, they are unable
            to go to their workplace and are instead forced to remotely complete
            this task. <br />2. Their plan would likely be to allot a fixed
            amount of time in their day to sit down and begin working on their
            assigned coding section. <br />3. Because it would be unlikely that
            the user would be able to complete their task within a day, they
            could then specify which portion or segment of code they could work
            on. <br />4. After specifying this, the user would then perform
            their action. However, because of the direct lack of supervision or
            perhaps being unable to properly focus due to not being at their
            physical workspace, the user may be unable to complete their task.
            <br />5. After having finished coding the segment they specified
            (whether successfully or unsuccessfully), the user would likely
            perceive that they have finished (or haven’t finished) their task,
            and are now able to evaluate the work they did. <br />6. If the user
            was able to complete their task, they could interpret that they were
            able to understand what their role asked of them. If the user was
            unable to complete their task, they may interpret that this was due
            to the fact that remote work has made their job much more difficult
            and being unable to work in their typical workspace has made it much
            harder to focus as they may have been more prone to distractions at
            home that otherwise wouldn’t have occurred at work. <br />7. Thus,
            depending on whether the user completed this task or not, they could
            then compare their goal of completing a portion of their code to the
            reality of whether they did or not. <br />
            Our group believes this kind of interaction is typical because of
            the fact that Covid-19 has forced many companies to work remotely,
            meaning that many, if not all of their employees are unable to
            return to their offices to complete their tasks, and must instead
            work or collaborate online.

          <h5 class="card-title title">2. Identify your potential users.</h5>
          <p class="card-text response">
            Our group believes that the user population affected by our study is
            anybody attempting some form of remote work, whether that’s a
            student attending classes online, to an employee at a Fortune 500
            company being forced to work remotely from home. The related tasks
            this user population performs is the aforementioned task of
            attempting to complete some form of task online or remotely from
            home that they otherwise would have been doing at their appropriate
            workspace if not for the pandemic. Users could benefit from some
            sort of solution to mitigating distractions and issues with
            time-management caused by remote work by being able to be more
            productive or simply being able to complete their assigned tasks. In
            doing so, this hypothetical solution could also aid in helping them
            learn from completing or working on their task in the same way they
            would have if they had been at their appropriate workspace
            completing said task.

              <p class="card-text response">Small, single-paged timer app based on the time management technique, Pomodoro. The technique is comprised of 3 timer settings: Pomodoro which is a 25 minute interval, a Short Break which is a 5 minute interval, and a Long Break which is a 10 minute interval. The Pomodoro is a work or study interval. After the Pomodoro interval, the participant must take a short break. After four Pomodoro intervals, the participant must take a long break. <br/><br/>
                The interface has 3 buttons for each of intervals, labeled as such, with a digital clock below, which is set to the interval time when the corresponding button is clicked. When an interval is selected, the digital clock begins to decrement. The clock’s behavior can be changed via the 3 buttons below it: Start which will make the clock begin to decrement if paused, Stop which pauses the clock’s decrementing, and Reset which resets the clock the max time for the currently selected interval. There is also a log button on the right side of the page’s header. The log button, when clicked, displays a pop-up with a list of your interval history. Each interval in the list has a textbox to describe what was accomplished during the interval.<br/><br/>
                Pros: Very simple design; Narrowly focused on single time management technique which it does well<br/><br/>
                Cons: Not an “all-in-one” time management app; Useful for time managing during work periods but not for planning

            <p class="card-text response">Notion is a larger app useful for life management, notetaking, project management, and generally storing one’s information. Notion has a sidebar on the left side of the screen where a user can add a page. Pages generally contain specific topics or events that the user would like to store information about it and plans it involves. Each page has a header section and a content section, below the header. To edit the header, a user must click on the large text that says “Untitled” and begin typing or by editing the page name in the sidebar (by right clicking and selecting “Rename”). By clicking the white space below the header or the content currently on the page, the user is able to add content to the page. The content of a page is broken into multiple sections of content. The user can select these by clicking on the “+” icon to the left of the content line they are currently on. <br/><br/>
                Notion has a variety of content options to choose from. A user can add plain text, kanban boards, existing calendars, tables, galleries, images, files, code snippets, mathematical notion, and etc. all into a single Notion page.<br/><br/>
                Pros: “All-in-one” task manager; Good for planning work and storing information for quick access<br/><br/>
                Cons: Size of app can be cumbersome for new users;

                To create a solution, instead of creating a new application, we want to make existing applications more user friendly and more applicable to remote work. We also want to make these applications more applicable to the common employee, and let the user 1) easily discern what work needs to be done 2) How to document work done 3) and communicate with coworkers easily. These 3 steps will make remote work more efficient and lower distractions. Seeing exactly what needs to be done, and a deadline for when it needs to be done will motivate users to finish work. Documenting the work being done will make sure that work is done quickly and efficiently, and is ready to be reviewed whenever completed. Being able to quickly communicate issues/questions will lower the amount of time spent searching for answers. Updating these apps with clear signifiers and mapping with affordances will optimize and streamline the application’s usage. This will build good habits of productivity and self-accountability in the absence of a physical workplace.</br>

                    Pomodoro is a very simple app that is based on the time management technique of the Pomodoro Method in which users work for a 25-minute interval, and are then given a 5-minute break. This is about the extent of the application, as its functionality is very basic and is only used for the sake of helping keep users focused. However, we can make some improvements to Pomodoro such that users are given more flexibility and customization in how they wish to manage their time. The only customization users can currently make with the app is changing the amount of time their breaks and work time lasts. Having some sort of integration with a calendar or perhaps being able to plan in advance when to set Pomodoros may help in keeping users better focused and cognizant of when they should be productive.

                    Notion has an incredible amount of variety and can be applicable to all aspects of an individual’s life. The vast amount of uses makes it daunting to a first time user when trying to utilize Notion. We can make Notion more applicable to a remote work environment by highlighting specific sections to document tasks to be done during the day. Sending notifications when a meeting is about to come. Have a boss set daily requirements and have the user use Notion to check off what is done, when it is done. Make Notion more user friendly when first starting out so an employee can easily begin to document their work and what needs to be done.

            <p class="card-text response">
                Measuring success can simply be done by first monitoring how many tasks or sprints are completed by a team without using these applications. Then, monitor how much of a sprint or task is done in the same time frame while employees are using the streamlined applications. If the amount of tasks completed while remotely working and using the apps are larger than the amount of tasks not using the apps, then we know that the apps had a positive impact on work productivity, and were being used efficiently by the employees.

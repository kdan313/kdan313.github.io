            <strong>User Story 1:</strong> As a user, I want to be able to access a portal that lets me look at my schedule for the week ahead that allows me to schedule any tasks I may have to do, so that I can keep them in mind and be productive when those time slots occur.</br></br>
            <strong>User Story 2:</strong> As a user, I want to be able to add a task and assign designated time for the task in my agenda, so that I can create a schedule for my productivity.</br></br>
            <strong>User Story 3:</strong> As a user, I want to be able to edit an existing task in my schedule</br></br>
            <strong>User Story 4:</strong> As a user, I want to be able to begin a task, which will start a Pomodoro timer and a timer counting down from that task's designated time, so that I can designate an amount of time to stay focused for.</br></br>
            <strong>User Story 5:</strong> As a user, I want to be able to change the amount of time allotted for breaks and studying that the app assigns (defaults to Pomodoro method), so that I can adjust these times to better suit my needs or preferences.</br></br>
            <strong>User Story 6:</strong> As a user, I want to be able to quickly access a checklist which shows which tasks are done and which tasks need to be done, so that I can keep track of the amount of tasks I have and haven't completed.

                The user stories most relevant to our group's proposed solution are all of the ones we've mentioned in section A. We believe this to be the case because these user stories establish the framework of our app, and the basic functionalities, design philosophies, and interactions that the user will be able to accomplish.

                    <strong>Alternative 1:</strong> Currently, the plan for the Pomodoro timer is that it will count down without any way to pause. An alternative would be to add some sort of pause or stop button.</br>

                    <strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Instead of the task automatically beginning a Pomodoro timer, the user can choose to manually begin the Pomodoro timer by clicking a button (this option can be changed in the settings of the application).</br>
